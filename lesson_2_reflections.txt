What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- It creates the meta info for git use in a hidden folder called ".git".
- Without doing git init, the directory is just an ordinary directory/folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- It's a git managed snapshot area that track additions of new files to a repo.
- It helps to provide a working area for you to roll back files you may not want to commit to a repo, making the repo commit history easier to understand.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- After making a change to a file, run git add to stage the change to staging area;
- Then run git commit to commit to the git repo.
- This way, there wil always be 1 commit to any single (logical) change.
